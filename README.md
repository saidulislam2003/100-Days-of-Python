![Cover Image](python-banner.png)

Welcome to the **100 Days of Python** repository! 🎉

This repository documents my journey of learning Python programming over 100 days. My goal is to practice daily, improve my coding skills, and build meaningful projects while sharing everything I learn along the way.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Find Here
- **Daily Progress**: A log of what I learned and practiced each day.
- **Code Files**: Scripts and programs I wrote as part of my learning process.
- **Mini Projects**: Small projects showcasing concepts learned during the journey.
- **Challenges**: Problem-solving exercises and coding challenges.

## 🔥 Motivation
Python is a versatile language widely used in fields like web development, data science, machine learning, and more. By committing to 100 days of consistent learning, I aim to:
- Strengthen my understanding of Python basics.
- Dive into advanced topics and libraries.
- Build a strong foundation for real-world applications.

## 🗓️ Progress Tracker
| Day | Topic/Task | Summary |
|-----|------------|---------|
| 1   | Introduction to Python | Variables, Data Types, and Print Statements |
| 2   | Control Flow | If-Else Statements and Loops |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 100 | Final Project | TBD |

## 🚀 Goals
1. Learn Python fundamentals and advanced concepts.
2. Explore popular Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Flask, Django).
3. Build and document at least 5 projects by the end of the journey.
